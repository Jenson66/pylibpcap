pylibpcap
=========

A libpcap module for Python.

This is a fork I made from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pylibpcap.

The only adjustment I've done is make it enter monitor mode. The only reason, really, is because I needed this for my device_sniffer at https://github.com/ephracis/device_sniffer.
